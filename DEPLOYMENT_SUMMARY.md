## What's Been Implemented

Your Expense Split PWA now has a complete **automated deployment pipeline** to AWS S3 + CloudFront with GitHub Actions.

## 📁 Files Added

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- `.github/workflows/deploy-pwa.yml` - Complete CI/CD pipeline

### AWS Setup Scripts

- `scripts/setup-aws-infrastructure.sh` - Automated AWS infrastructure setup
- `scripts/deploy-setup.sh` - Interactive setup wizard

### Documentation

- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - This quick reference

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Setup AWS Infrastructure

```bash
# Interactive setup (recommended)
./scripts/deploy-setup.sh

# Or direct setup
./scripts/setup-aws-infrastructure.sh your-bucket-name us-east-1
```

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets

Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions and add:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
- `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 3. Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: setup deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Automatic Deployment** on push to main
- ✅ **PWA Optimization** with proper caching
- ✅ **CloudFront CDN** for global performance
- ✅ **Service Worker** caching strategies
- ✅ **Environment Variables** support
- ✅ **Manual Deployment** trigger option
- ✅ **Cost Optimization** (~$1.38/month)

## 📊 Deployment Process

1. **Code Push** → GitHub detects changes
2. **Build Process** → PWA built with optimizations
3. **Deploy to S3** → Files uploaded with proper caching
4. **CloudFront Invalidation** → CDN cache cleared
5. **Live PWA** → Available worldwide via CDN

## 🔍 Monitoring

- **GitHub Actions**: Build logs and deployment status
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Performance and error metrics
- **S3 Console**: File uploads and storage usage
- **CloudFront Console**: CDN performance and cache hits

```bash
# Local development
npm run web

# Production build
npm run pwa:build

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Deployment fails    | Check GitHub secrets are set correctly       |
| PWA won't install   | Ensure HTTPS and valid manifest              |
| Changes not showing | CloudFront cache - wait 5-15 minutes         |
| Build errors        | Check environment variables and dependencies |
